# LAKE User Story - Demonstration Scenario

## Background
Sarah is a Knowledge Manager at TechCorp who needs to organize thousands of documents across multiple departments. Her team struggles with finding relevant documents quickly because they lack proper metadata and filtering capabilities.

## Current Pain Points
- Documents are uploaded to S3 without consistent metadata
- Knowledge Base searches return too many irrelevant results
- No way to filter by department, date, or document type
- Manual metadata tagging is time-consuming and inconsistent

## Solution Journey

### Step 1: Initial Setup (30 seconds)
**Sarah configures LAKE for her organization**

1. **Deploy LAKE solution** using CDK
2. **Configure metadata rules** 

### Step 2: Automatic Metadata Generation (45 seconds)
**Sarah uploads documents and sees automatic metadata generation**

1. **Upload a sales report** to S3 bucket
   - File: `Q3_Sales_Report_2024.pdf`
   - LAKE automatically generates metadata:
     ```json
     {
       "department": "sales",
       "document_type": "report",
       "sensitivity_level": "internal",
       "date_created": "2024-10-23",
       "keywords": ["Q3", "revenue", "targets"]
     }
     ```

2. **Upload meeting minutes** via email
   - Send email to: `upload@lake.techcorp.com`
   - Attach: `Engineering_Standup_Oct23.docx`
   - LAKE processes and generates metadata automatically

### Step 3: Enhanced Search Experience (45 seconds)
**Sarah demonstrates improved Knowledge Base search**

1. **Search with filters**:
   - Query: "sales reports last month"
   - LAKE filters by: `department=sales`, `document_type=report`, `date_created>=2024-09-01`
   - Returns only relevant sales reports from September

2. **Department-specific search**:
   - Query: "engineering meeting-minutes this week"
   - Returns only engineering meeting minutes from current week

### Step 4: Metadata Management (30 seconds)
**Sarah manages and monitors metadata**

1. **Request metadata statistics** via email:
   - Send: "Get metadata stats" to `reports@lake.techcorp.com`
   - Receives summary: "150 documents processed, 5 departments, 12 document types"

2. **Review and adjust rules**:
   - Check which documents need better categorization
   - Update `config.yaml` for improved accuracy

## Key Benefits Demonstrated
