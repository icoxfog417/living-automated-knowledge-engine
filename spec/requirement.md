# LAKE: Living Automated Knowledge Engine - Requirements

## Project Overview

LAKE is an automatic metadata generation agent that provides one-click deployment for customers using S3 buckets as knowledge sources, eliminating manual metadata creation for Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases.

## Problem Statement

- Poor metadata management severely limits RAG accuracy in knowledge bases
- Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases requires customers to prepare metadata.json files for all documents
- Column-specific metadata required for tabular data
- Labor-intensive requirements lead customers to abandon proper metadata management
- Results in degraded accuracy and reliance on expensive high-performance models

## Solution Requirements

### Core Functionality
- **Automatic Metadata Generation**: Analyze files in S3 buckets to generate appropriate tags based on user-defined parameters
- **One-Click Deployment**: Seamless integration with existing S3 knowledge sources
- **Continuous Organization**: AI-powered librarian that continuously organizes and optimizes knowledge sources
- **Minimal Human Intervention**: Automated metadata management with user oversight

### Integration Requirements
- **S3 Integration**: Direct integration with customer S3 buckets as knowledge sources
- **Bedrock Knowledge Bases**: Generate metadata.json files compatible with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases
- **Communication Channels**: Support interaction through email and Slack
- **Metadata Statistics**: Provide customers with metadata statistics and update capabilities

### Technical Requirements
- Support for document files requiring metadata.json generation
- Support for tabular data requiring column-specific metadata
- User-defined parameter configuration for tag generation
- Automated file analysis and classification

## Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- **RAG Accuracy Improvement**: 40% increase in RAG accuracy
- **Cost Reduction**: 60% reduction in knowledge management costs
- **Deployment Rate**: Match or exceed the doubled deployment rates achieved by previous generative AI solutions

### User Experience
- One-click deployment capability
- Familiar interaction channels (email, Slack)
- Minimal technical barriers to implementation
- Continuous optimization without manual intervention

## Target Customers

- Organizations using S3 buckets as knowledge sources
- Customers requiring Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases integration
- Teams seeking to improve RAG accuracy without specialized metadata expertise
- Organizations looking to reduce knowledge management operational costs

## Constraints

- Must integrate seamlessly with existing S3 infrastructure
- Must generate metadata compatible with Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases format
- Must support both document and tabular data sources
- Must provide user control over metadata generation parameters
